			<h2>Blissful Escape to Cancun: Sun, Sand, and Salsa</h2>
            <div>
			<p>Preamble
                At the start of the year, I was super pumped for my upcoming trip to Peru in April. I had everything planned out and was ready for an awesome adventure. Unfortunately, things took a turn for the worse when civil unrest broke out in the country, and I had to cancel my plans for the fourth time. It was definitely a bummer, but I wasn't about to let it ruin my travel plans altogether.
                That's when I turned my attention to another classic Spring Break destination - Cancun, Mexico! As someone who's been around the block a few times, having explored Tulum, Cozumel, and Costa Maya on previous cruises, I knew that the crystal-clear blue waters and tropical sunshine would be hard to resist. Even though Cancun was completely new to me, I was excited to explore everything this popular vacation spot had to offer.
                Resort Choices              
                Oh, the joys of planning a vacation! As we contemplated our spring break getaway, we knew we had to be strategic with our timing to avoid the hordes of tourists and the exorbitant prices that come with peak season.
                Shoulder season seemed like the sensible choice, and after poring
                Beach Bliss
                over countless travel blogs and videos on YouTube, we finally found the perfect resort. Our beloved kiddo1 was flying in from New York to join us, and the pressure was on to choose the right spot.
                    Paradisus and the Riu hotels were at the top of our list, but we couldn't agree on which one to go for. I was enchanted by Paradisus, but my husband was smitten with the Riu's bizarre purple and blue decor. As we weighed our options, we had to consider the geography of Cancun itself.
                                The city is divided into distinct regions, each with its own vibe and attractions. The further up north you go, the more serene and affordable the resorts become, but the water isn't quite as clear. The Hotel Zonalera, on the other hand, is the epicenter of Cancun's party scene and boasts stunning ocean views, but it comes at a premium.
                                                                After much deliberation, we decided on the Grand Park Royale Cancun resort & spa, located right in the heart of the hotel zone. The all-inclusive package was too tempting to resist, and we were thrilled to secure two premier oceanfront rooms with direct beach access.
                  All-Inclusive!
                The hotel's chic color scheme and tasteful design won me over, and my husband was ecstatic that it was reasonably priced. But no trip to the beach is without its quirks, and we had to keep an eye out for the dreaded sargassum seaweed that tends to invade the shores. You know with too much sargassum in play there may not be much else in play - hehe!
                                Packing & Repacking!
                
                                Travelocity has a treasure trove of bundle deals that can help you save some precious money while booking your travels. Their hotels + flights package is a true gem, so make sure to explore this option.
                                After a lot of research, we finally decided on Spirit flights that cost us $180 per person roundtrip, but we were not expecting the additional baggage charges of $120 per bag. So, we agreed to take only 2 big suitcases that would weigh less than 40 pounds. I had already packed everything a week before, but when Kiddo1 arrived, she had an urge to pack a bunch more stuff at the last minute. Since we had to leave for Orlando at 2.30 AM, I decided to not rearrange everything and instead
                  Idyllic
                carried a lightweight expandable rucksack, which we lovingly call the "Nelson bag". It is very handy and is always the perfect solution for overflow items. It was named after Nelson, who always gives us such thoughtful and useful swag gifts.
                                We woke up at the crack of dawn, rounded up everyone, and finally managed to leave the house by 3.30 AM. Since we missed our India flight back in 2016 and lost $5,000, you'd think we would have learned our lesson by now. But some habits die hard! I had to hustle and bustle to make sure everyone's belongings were properly loaded.
                
                The drive to Orlando was accompanied by thick fog, which made me incredibly nervous. But we arrived at the airport in good time. As expected, our bags were slightly overweight by about 8 pounds. However, we quickly took out the Nelson bag and transferred some items over.
                                Before boarding our 1.5-hour flight to Cancun, we grabbed a scrumptious spinach quiche and croissant. I was really looking forward to some much-needed rest and relaxation.
                
                               
                Life's Unexpected Curve Ball:
                
                               As we taxied out, I couldn't help but feel overwhelmed with emotion. You see, life
                  Making memories
                has thrown us some unexpected curveballs lately. My husband's cancer diagnosis and our youngest daughter's battle with depression have left us feeling exhausted and dejected.
                                But despite these challenges, I knew we needed to take a break from it all. We needed to escape, even if just for a little while, and focus on the present moment.
                                During the flight, my mind wandered as I thought about the challenges our family has faced. But then, my heart swelled with pride as I overheard my daughters chatting in the seat next to me. They were talking about how their friends often mention that we are model parents, and how they hope to emulate us one day. It was a small moment, but it filled me with so much joy and gratitude.
                                As we landed in Cancun and stepped off the plane, I felt a sense of excitement and anticipation. I knew this trip wouldn't solve all of our problems, but it would give us a chance to breathe, to laugh, and to create new memories together. And for that, I am forever grateful.
