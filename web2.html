			<h2>LADY ELLIOT ISLAND...100% Eco Paradise</h2>
			<p>80 kms off the Queensland coast accessed by 12 seater plane from Bundaberg or Hervey Bay is a tiny coral cay that is 100 percent Eco and 100 percent satisfaction.

                The southern most island of the Great Barrier Reef and a haven for corals, seabirds, colourful fish, manta rays, turtles & humans...limited to 330 guests who snorkel, scuba dive, bask or otherwise simply enjoy the teeming wildlife.
                
                Where else can you find a piece of paradise where there is Nil to complain about?
                
                As Jack Johnson sings "In times like these...what will be will be...and so it goes."
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                A last minute plan to spend time with my sister for Christmas in Queensland leads to a few days on a previously booked out tropical island.
                
                Who'd have thought?
                
                How often do last minute plans lead to serendipity in over drive?
                
                When Denise & I 'wing it' in travel...it happens quite often we find!
                
                ******
                
                
                
                My sister lives within a stones throw of Woodgate Beach near Bundaberg, Queensland...invitations to visit were tempting but during Covid, Aussie state borders were closed.
                
                Denise & I are travellers 
                Gotta flyGotta fly
                Gotta fly
                who need to fly. So in mid December I rang my sister and asked if we could stay with her for a few weeks for Christmas 2022...she delighted to oblige...suggesting we must include time on Lady Elliot Island, the Manta Ray capital.
                
                Onto the internet...of course it was booked out for months.
                
                Then a small opening for an Eco cabin for 3 nights from Boxing Day (26 December 2022) so I rang the Resort and they were even more surprised than me that a vacancy had suddenly opened.
                
                Booked it...gotta pack...get to the airport...the Dancing Ones are coming.
                
                
                
                What to bring
                
                Purchased a GoPro Black 11 and got hints from our son in Canada who is the GoPro & Drone King. Now I have waterproof camera gear in addition to my usual.
                
                Reef Shoes obligatory for a tiny coral cay surrounded by coral reefs...boardies...sunburn cream...shorts...shirts...undies...toothbrush & toiletries...medications...that's about all. The island supplies linen, towels & snorkeling gear.
                
                Luggage as little as possible as max 15kg per person for the small plane to the island. Lucky that doesn't include my carry-on camera gear!
                
                
                
                How to get there
                
                40 
                
                minute flight in a 12 seater plane 83 kms from Bundaberg to Lady Elliot...others can fly 120kms from Hervey Bay...the island like a tiny beating heart in the endless Pacific sea...bouncing on landing as the tarmac is dirt and grass... pilot so skilful to him like sipping a cup of tea.
                
                
                
                What to find
                
                The adverts on the internet are punchy & brief:
                
                "Over 1,200 species of marine life - manta rays, turtles, and unspoilt coral reef. Natural Beauty. Eco Friendly. Picture Your Toes In The Sand! Best Snorkeling In Aust. Guided Diving Tours. Crystal Clear Water. Home Of The Manta Ray. Low-Key Eco Resort."
                
                If that's the Welcome Mat...being there reveals much, much more
                
                
                
                History
                
                Said to never have been part of the Australian mainland it is believed it first was above sea level as a coral shingle spit about 3,500 years ago. Thereafter storms deposited coral shingle providing nesting areas for seabirds whose dropping led to its surface being raised and vegetated.
                
                It is thus a coral shingle cay rather than a sand coral cay.
                
                Walking along the shorelines that surround the island is an adventure 
                Feeding her chickFeeding her chick
                Feeding her chick
                navigating the crunch and slip and slide of massive deposits of coral shingle with rocks of fossilised corals thereon.
                
                The remainder of the island is raised and land and sand/soil-formed without the crunch.
                
                The island was discovered in 1803 which resulted in a brief period in 1805 of sea cumber farming for the Asian delicacy market, abandoned when depleted.
                
                In 1816 it was rediscovered by Captain Thomas Stuart in the ship 'Lady Elliot' and the island was thus named.
                
                Between 1863 to 1873 it was mined for guano (bird poo) for fertiliser and gunpowder removing layers of deposits (about 1 metre of topsoil and 20,000 tonnes of guano).
                
                This removed all vegetation except 8 Pisonia trees that were retained as shade from the tropical sun and rain for the Chinese & Malay workers.
                
                The 8 Pisonia trees remain to this day but the coral cay was so bare that seabirds abandoned it for nesting and only a lighthouse with its lonelier lighthouse keeper's families was its sole reason for habitation. The graveyard of misery, a daughter died of pneumonia in 1896 and suicides of a lighthouse keeper's wife in 1907 are sobering indeed.

                In 1969, a keen aviator Don Adams built an airstrip and commenced conservation, revegetation and tourism on Lady Elliot with the assistance of Commonwealth Government grants, receiving a conservation award in 1994 for his revegetation achievements. By the late 1980s trees obstructed the effectiveness of the lighthouse requiring in 1994 a 43 metre fully automated light tower with 6 revolving light beams visible for 40 kms from the island.
                
                The current operators took over the lease in 2005 from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and have worked tirelessly to create one of the highest ecologically friendly tourism locales, not only in the Great Barrier Reef but in Australia.
                
                The solar power station, desalinated water, reduction in diesel use and carbon carbon emissions by over 70 percent...awards for Advanced Eco Certification...truly inspiring.
                
                With revegetation the seabirds returned...once a barren wasteland now an island with the second highest diversity on the Great Barrier Reef with about 100 species of land sea migratory birds...and NO predators.
                
                The air filled with birds...the sea filled with coral reefs and sea life aplenty...the island a pleasure to wander and enjoy.

                is often highlighted by the people we meet.
                
                Our first greeting was Sandy in the Dive Shop who claimed to be "The Good Looking One"...but with its band of super capable and friendly diving guides, marine and bird experts, chefs and hospitality staff, he had plenty of competition!
                
                Fitted us out with flippers & snorkel gear and booked us in for our introductory snorkel lesson.
                
                As we headed to our Eco Cabin I got waylaid.
                
                
                
                LEI Birds by their thousands
                
                White-capped or Brown Noddys in every branch of every tree...nests of twigs and leaves...one on the nest...its partner for life beside or fetching more nesting materials...white bird droppings like cake icing flowing from each...incessant squawks...Bridled and Crested Terns also filling the shoreline trees...a strutting Eastern Reef Egret...Buff-Banded Rails, Pacific Golden Plovers and Capricorn Silvereyes searching for insects...watching and ducking as I walk while Noddys and Terns swoop head high!
                
                Armadas of Frigate Birds patrolling the skies with pairs of smaller birds in synch sweeping, darting or swooping...the occasional Sea Eagle avoided by others.
                
                I got up up one morning at 4:30am to catch the 5 a.m. sunrise...thousands and thousands of birds 
                Greeting the sunriseGreeting the sunrise
                Greeting the sunrise
                suddenly emerging together from the trees...crossing the reef in saturated battalions greeting the first glimpse of the sun...then swooping back to enjoy their day.
                
                The Eco cabin suited us fine...we each had a lower bunkbed with all our gear loaded on top. Full glass frontages with heavy curtains & sliding doors, louvered windows to catch the breeze...pairs of terns holidaying, caring for chicks or fighting on the steps & below every window...perfect to sit on the deck and watch the bird carnival in the sky.
                
                But late at night was another World. Cosy in our cabin awoken by screams from the wooded area behind our cabin.</p>
