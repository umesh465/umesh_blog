			<h2>Jungle treks and rocky scrambles</h2>
			<p>At the start of the year, I was super pumped for my upcoming trip to Peru in April. I had everything planned out and was ready for an awesome adventure. Unfortunately, things took a turn for the worse when civil unrest broke out in the country, and I had to cancel my plans for the fourth time. It was definitely a bummer, but I wasn't about to let it ruin my travel plans altogether.
            That's when I turned my attention to another classic Spring Break destination - Cancun, Mexico! As someone who's been around the block a few times, having explored Tulum, Cozumel, and Costa Maya on previous cruises, I knew that the crystal-clear blue waters and tropical sunshine would be hard to resist. Even though Cancun was completely new to me, I was excited to explore everything this popular vacation spot had to offer.</p>
